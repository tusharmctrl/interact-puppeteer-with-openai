Hey Team, some exciting updates from my sides. I have created one script - using which we can directly make puppeteer with our model. for example - in the prompt if we say go visit "stake.com" and click on register button and capture a screenshot, our puppeteer will do that and simulataneously our model will stream the expected results as we go along the way. Hopefully, we will make some tweaks to the script and make it more smoother. Good news is our puppeteer-real-browser works perfectly fine with the script, so for now - we're able to bypass the restricted sites as well. There's still some work needs to be done, which we'll take care of soon - and then we can start examining our heuristic on the given script.
