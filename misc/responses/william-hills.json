Couldn't find the offer, used their chat bot to enquire why and was told my account had been deactivated with no explanation. Spent over 2 hours, being passed to at least 6 people, submitted countless photos with ID - which in spite of a premium phone camera - were not 'clear' enough, only to be told another department would email me. They did, and asked me to do everything again as if I had contacted no-one before. So in my opinion, from falsely advertising an offer to now refusing to re-open my account or refund my money, I smell a rotten scam.",

Haven't won on their bingo in 2 years, always the same names winning though eh?? I can easily rip through £100 in less than an hour and the slots have played terrible for the last 8 months, if you are lucky enough to get a scatter/bonus round rest assured they'll only allow you to scrape the minimum win. Just spent my last tenner on their site and not a single penny back on the lowest stake available, thats a lot of empty spins! Their promos have turned into a slap in the face too, you used to regularly get 5 free spins, now you have to stake £5 to get any, and they are always on a game that no one with half a brain would actually spend real money on! I'm convinced they've tweaked their site so getting a payout is impossible, the rtp has most definitely been altered yet customers aren't informed before play which would at least give us an option on whether to deposit or not. it's not all about luck, even the dodgiest bookie has to pay out now and again or they would have no business. The law of averages should come into play at some point, throwing money at them in the hopes of clawing something back has become my norm and i'm so fed up with it.",

I used to champion this site for being the only one that had fair play, not anymore. 30 games of slingo and not a single, even bare minimum win, thats appalling by anybodies standards. Haven't won on their bingo in 2 years, always the same names winning though eh?? I can easily rip through £100 in less than an hour and the slots have played terrible for the last 8 months, if you are lucky enough to get a scatter/bonus round rest assured they'll only allow you to scrape the minimum win. Just spent my last tenner on their site and not a single penny back on the lowest stake available, thats a lot of empty spins! Their promos have turned into a slap in the face too, you used to regularly get 5 free spins, now you have to stake £5 to get any, and they are always on a game that no one with half a brain would actually spend real money on! I'm convinced they've tweaked their site so getting a payout is impossible, the rtp has most definitely been altered yet customers aren't informed before play which would at least give us an option on whether to deposit or not. it's not all about luck, even the dodgiest bookie has to pay out now and again or they would have no business. The law of averages should come into play at some point, throwing money at them in the hopes of clawing something back has become my norm and i'm so fed up with it.",

My brother registered me with my permission for self exclusion which ended on the 31st August 2023. It was confirmed by gamstop my exclusion period had ended. I went through half and hour conversation with William Hill safer gambling team they opened my account 48 hours later. Now just under 11 months later they are possibly going to close my account again. It's now under review. To be honest with you my problem isn't gambling I waste more money playing app games because I get competitive. With gambling I do not chase my losses. With my games I obviously always lose because I can't win money playing. Top eleven manager or mini football",
