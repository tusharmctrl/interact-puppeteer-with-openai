I wouldn't be able to fit in all the words about everything i've experienced on Stake. 500$ deposited today to spin slots and I can't make this up, not a SINGLE trajectory upwards in my gambling session chart, straight down, no bump ups, no hits. straight down. Imagine 10+ pages of deposits (100+).. and guess what 1 withdrawal. not 1 page of withdrawals, ONE withdrawal. and that was because I needed spare money in the moment. I frequently go 1000 spins without a bonus on majority of slots, and when i get a bonus, it pays 10x the bet size; Lose 200$ to make 3$, is usually how it goes every session. in the past 3 months, 90 deposits, once a day, and 0 withdrawals, and I'm not even aiming to make millions or hundreds of thousands, maybe just some of RTP That i'm still yet to see. I would love to be able to deposit and 3x-4x my balance and leave, but can't even 2x or 1.5x it. charts straight red every session, most slots claim 90% rtp but I've literally spun every single pragmatic slot on stake, and haven't even hit a 1000x. Is my account limited? No clue; literally never won so I don't know why I would be. They say it's luck but that's lies. I've done a lot of gamble actives, pack openings which have WAY less odds than stake rewarding for what you put in, but somehow still manage to get rewarded more times than stake.
